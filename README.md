# Marketing Analytics & Customer Segmentation: Classical Machine Learning Framework

## Project Overview

Developed a comprehensive marketing analytics system implementing classical machine learning algorithms for customer segmentation, churn prediction, and lifetime value estimation using Python. Engineered RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis framework and deployed multiple clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) to segment 5,000+ customers into actionable business cohorts. Implemented and benchmarked six classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees) achieving 85%+ ROC-AUC in churn prediction, alongside regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso) for CLV forecasting with R² > 0.75. Applied advanced feature engineering, PCA dimensionality reduction, and cross-validation techniques to optimize model performance. Delivered business-ready insights through dynamic visualizations and statistical analysis to drive data-driven marketing strategies and customer retention initiatives.
